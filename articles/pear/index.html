          <section class="content"><p>The third project on the General Assembly <span class="caps">WDI</span> involved working in a group, and we were asked to integrate an API into the app. We decided to make a map app to be used for dating, where we would apply our own algorithm to dating venues to determine whether they were “flashy” or not. Users could filter the map to find dating locations to suit their&nbsp;preferences.</p>
<p>Whilst we had been exposed to some elements of working as a team of programmers on the course, such as daily stand-ups and pair-programming, the group project gave us more of an insight into what a professional programming environment might be like. For example, we used a shared Git repository for the project which gave us a greater understanding of using Git (even if it did cause a few issues at points). Working directly as a team also helped me to fully appreciate some of the benefits of using the techniques we had already been familiarized with (i.e. pair-programming and&nbsp;stand-ups).</p>
