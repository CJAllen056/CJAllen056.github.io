For the second project at General Assembly, we were to make a rails app with at least three linked models in an SQL database. I chose to make a book club app, whereby uses could seek out groups, filtered on a number of categories (e.g. book genre, location).

Whereas I had a little knowledge of JavaScript before beginning the WDI at General Assembly, I had never used Ruby before the course. It was interesting to see the both similarities and differences between the two languages as I learnt to work with Ruby, and it was cool to see how you could apply existing knowledge of coding when learning to pick up a new language.
