For the final project on the General Assembly WDI, we pretty much had free reign to do what we wanted. As I had really enjoyed the [first project](../split/index.md) I wanted to make another game, this time with a back-end to enable separate game rooms and socketing.

I decided to make a drawing guessing game, akin to Pictionary or Draw Something. One player is chosen as the drawer, and is given a prompt which they must attempt to convey through drawing on the canvas. The other players then have to guess the prompt in order to win points. The main challenge on the project was in setting up the socketing on the canvas and chat, so that all players in a room could see the game elements.
