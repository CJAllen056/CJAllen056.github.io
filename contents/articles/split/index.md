My first project at on the WDI programme was to build a game in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I chose to make a clone of the iPhone game SPL-T, developed by Simogo. Whilst I wasn’t able to fully copy all of the game’s mechanics in the 4 days we worked on the project, the final product did involve some complicated logic which I was very happy with considering I had only had 2 weeks of JavaScript training.
